This project is mainly for my own education and amusement and is put online as a way to pick up Git and Github while at
the same time learning some more Clojure.
The code in this project is an implementation of the [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
algorithm which calculates the minimum number of edit operations to get from one string to another.
